# Technical Assessment — PDF Name Extractor & RAG API

## Overview

You are given a **partially implemented** application that extracts names from scanned PDF documents, identifies their bounding box locations, performs fuzzy matching, and answers questions using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

The codebase has **bugs, missing features, and poor engineering practices**. Your task is to fix, complete, and improve it.

```

## Your Tasks

### 1. Fix All Bugs

Run the test suite with `pytest -v`. Multiple tests are **failing due to bugs** in the implementation. Find and fix each bug.

### 2. Refactor Architecture

The current codebase has significant design issues. Think about classes, abstractions, and SOLID principles.

### 3. Implement Software Engineering Best Practices

The codebase is missing critical production practices. Think about logging, configuration (look for hardcoded values), resilience, and validation.

### 4. Complete Missing Features

Some expected functionality is not implemented. The tests will guide you.

### 5. Containerization

- Create a `Dockerfile` for the application.
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` that includes all required services.
- Ensure the container can be built and run with `docker compose up`.

### 6. Design Document

Include a `DESIGN.md` (max 3 pages) covering:
- Component diagram showing all services and dependencies.
- Sequence diagram for both API endpoints.
- Technology choice justifications and tradeoffs.
- Scaling strategy for 1000+ PDFs/hour.
- Failure modes and mitigations.
- LLM routing strategy (if you were to add model selection based on query complexity).

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| All tests passing (bugs fixed correctly) | 20% |
| Architecture and design patterns | 20% |
| Software engineering best practices | 20% |
| Code quality and decisions | 15% |
| Design document | 10% |
| Containerization | 10% |
| Bonus: additional tests you write | 5% |

## Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run tests (many will fail — that's expected)
pytest -v

# Start Qdrant (required for integration tests)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Run the app
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
